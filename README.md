# Machine Learning Design Patterns

The field of Data Science, although seemingly complex, is in essence an exploration of information and the patterns within.

Data science encompasses various methods and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This repository is devoted to a deeper understanding of data science, particularly finding solutions to common challenges in Data Preparation, Model Building and MLOps, with exercises and solutions from the well-regarded book "Machine Learning Design Patterns" (Valliappa Lakshmanan, Sara Robinson & Michael Munn, 2020).

The primary aim of this repository is to provide an accessible yet comprehensive resource to those embarking on their journey in the field of data science. The repository will provide explanations, solutions, and insights into the numerous exercises contained within the aforementioned book.
